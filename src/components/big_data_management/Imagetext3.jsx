            In todayâ€™s world where nothing happens without the internet, it
            seems unlikely however there are still a lot of areas where people
            do not have internet. For material tracking or ISO requirements, the
            operators are still required to keep a record hand written which
            then gets re-typed to ERP systems. While the role may seem
            straightforward, attention to detail and accuracy are essential to
            ensure the reliability of the data used by other departments for
            decision-making and analysis. Our data entry specialists can provide
            a great added value where you have manual data such as written
            records or excel sheets that need to be loaded into an ERP system.
